import Pre from '../components/Pre.astro';
export const components = {pre: Pre}
import Demo from '../components/Demo'

```jsx
// Basic usage
import NumberFlow from '@number-flow/react'

<NumberFlow
    value={value}
    format={{ notation: 'compact' }} // Intl.NumberFormat() options
    locales="en-US" // Intl.NumberFormat() locales
/>
```

See [MDN's `Intl.NumberFormat()` reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/NumberFormat/NumberFormat#parameters) for a full list of `locales` and `format` options.

## Customizing

Number Flow accepts a `timings` prop to customize the transitions. See [MDN's `KeyframeEffect` reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyframeEffect/KeyframeEffect#options) for a full list of options.

{/* <DemoTransition client:load defaultValue="code"> */}
```jsx
import { easeOut } from 'framer-motion'

<NumberFlow
    timings={{
        x: { duration: 700, easing: 'ease-out' },
        y: { duration: 700, easing: 'ease-out' },
        opacity: { duration: 300, easing: 'ease' }
    }}
/>
```
{/* </DemoTransition> */}

For spring-based easings, I'd recommend [Kevin Grajeda's generator](https://www.kvin.me/css-springs).

There's also some CSS properties you can use to customize the component:

### `--mask-height`/`--mask-width`

These adjust the height and width of the gradient fade-out masks at the edges of the number.
`--mask-height` also gets used as the vertical padding for the number.

### `line-height`

In my opinion, the transitions look better with small vertical gaps between numbers, because it reduces the distance
they travel.
I recommend using the smallest `line-height` that fits all your component's characters (i.e. `0.8`).

## Limitations

* [Scientific](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/NumberFormat/NumberFormat#scientific) and [engineering](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/NumberFormat/NumberFormat#engineering) notations aren't currently supported
* Selected text inside the number will not respect color changes from `::selection`, if any
